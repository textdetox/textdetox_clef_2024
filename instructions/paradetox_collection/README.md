# Parallel Text Detoxification Dataset Collection Instructions

For each language, we collected parallel text detoxification pairs with toxic<->non-toxic pairs. To do so, either crowdsourcing or hired annotators were asked to perform paraphrasing. Then, the quality control was ensured. Mainly, the annotation process was like these steps:

**Task 1: Generation of Paraphrases**: The first crowdsourcing task asks users to eliminate toxicity in a given sentence while keeping the content.

**Task 2: Content Preservation Check**: We show users the generated paraphrases along with their original variants and ask them to indicate if they have close meanings.

**Task 3: Toxicity Check**: Finally, we check if the workers succeeded in removing toxicity.

For more details about annotators demographic and other details, please, refer to our report.
