# Test Set Models Answers Human Evaluation Instructions

![img](https://github.com/textdetox/textdetox_clef_2024/blob/main/instructions/human_evaluation/overall_evaluation_schema.png)

Here, we provide all instruction per each language and per each of three tasks that were used to assess participants' solutions on the [test set](https://huggingface.co/datasets/textdetox/multilingual_paradetox_test). From 600 samples per each language, we selected subset of 100 samples and put them through three tasks:

* toxicity: binary classification task if the sentence is toxic or not.
* content similarity: assessment if the paraphrase preserves the main content of the original sentence;
* fluency: if the sentence is fully fluent, partly-fluent, or non-fluent.
